# ðŸŒŠ Water Level Project

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Welcome to the Water Level Project! This innovative project leverages ultrasonic sensor technology to measure the water level in a vessel, transforming raw data into a visual display. With real-time feedback on water levels, it offers a practical solution for monitoring liquid storage.

## ðŸ”§ Components Used

- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** (HC-SR04 or PING)))
- **I2C LCD Display**
- **Connecting Wires**

## ðŸŒˆ Project Highlights

- **Distance Measurement**: The ultrasonic sensor sends out sound waves to detect the distance to the water surface, providing accurate measurements.
  
- **Volume Calculation**: Using a mathematical formula, the project calculates the volume of water based on the distance detected. 

- **User-Friendly Display**: The LCD screen presents the water volume as a percentage, making it easy to interpret.

- **Interactive Feedback**: The system communicates water levels through simple messages:
  - "Maji yanatosha..." (Water is sufficient)
  - "maji Hayatoshi" (Water is insufficient)

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Experience

This project not only enhances your technical skills but also provides a visually engaging way to monitor water levels. The combination of electronics and display brings your data to life!
